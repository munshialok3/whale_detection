# whale_detection
This repository contains all the essential codes, datasets, training models used for creating the project Whale Detection. This project is an Image classification project which uses computer vision techniques for the detection of a whale in the sea. The model was built using convolutional neural networks based on CAFFE framework and AlexNet architecture. This project uses DIGITS as it's base platform. This project was used for final evaluation and assessment in the course 'FUNDAMENTALS OF DEEP LEARNING AND COMPUTER VISION' by "NVIDIA DEEP LEARNING INSTITUTE". The model has an accuracy of 99% and it performed accurately in the final assessment.
